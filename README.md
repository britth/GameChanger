GameChanger
===========

Ever agonized over which game to watch during a tournament? GameChanger to the rescue! This command line tool mines relevant tweets and delivers up-to-the-minute updates on what everyone's talking about. GameChanger will let you know which games are going on at any given time, as well as which is most popular among Twitter users at that moment. It will also note 'game changing' moments of explosive Twitter activity, just in time for you to reach for your remote! 

Currently, GameChanger is being developed as a small demo program, focused on a short span of coverage during the 2014 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament. We would love for this to grow into a more powerful tool, covering a wide range of multi-game sporting events and presented in a real-time, attractive GUI. If you'd like to contribute, open an issue and code away! This project is openly available under an MIT License.
